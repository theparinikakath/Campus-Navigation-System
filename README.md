# Campus-Navigation-System
The "Campus Navigation System" is a simple yet effective application developed using C++ to assist students, faculty, and visitors in navigating a university campus. This system provides users with the shortest and most efficient routes between various buildings, departments, and other points of interest within the campus. By utilizing basic graph algorithms, the project aims to offer a user-friendly interface and accurate navigation guidance.
Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: The system features a text-based menu-driven interface that allows users to easily interact with the application.
Campus Map Representation: The campus is represented as a graph, where buildings and points of interest are nodes, and pathways between them are edges.
Shortest Path Calculation: Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, the system calculates and displays the shortest path between any two given locations on the campus.
Location Information: Provides basic information about each building, such as its name, purpose, and departments housed within.
Dynamic Updates: Users can dynamically add new buildings and pathways or modify existing ones to keep the map up-to-date.
Error Handling: The system includes error handling to manage invalid inputs and ensure a smooth user experience.
Technical Details
Programming Language: C++
Graph Representation: Adjacency list for efficient storage and manipulation of the campus map.
Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation.
Data Structures: Use of STL containers like vectors, maps, and priority queues to handle graph operations and data management.
Use Cases
New Students: Helps new students familiarize themselves with the campus layout and find the quickest routes to their classes.
Visitors: Assists visitors in locating specific buildings or departments without requiring a physical map.
Event Navigation: Guides users to event venues on campus, such as auditoriums, sports complexes, or exhibition halls.
Future Enhancements
Graphical Interface: Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for more intuitive interaction.
Real-Time Updates: Incorporating real-time data to reflect ongoing changes and construction within the campus.
Multilingual Support: Adding support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
Mobile Application: Extending the system to mobile platforms for greater accessibility.
The "Campus Navigation System" project serves as a practical and educational tool, demonstrating the application of graph algorithms in real-world scenarios and offering a valuable resource for campus navigation.
